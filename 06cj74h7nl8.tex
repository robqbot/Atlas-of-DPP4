\subsection{Vascular Diseases}
DPP4 inhibition in some clinical studies seems to lower blood pressure via vasodilation.~\cite{Kröller-Schön2012} This vasodialtory effects seems to be independent of circulating DPP4 substrates. Another clinical study using sitagliptin (at 50mg/d) and $\alpha$-glucosidase inhibitor voglibose (0.6mg/d) treating type II diabetes over a period of 12 weeks has found significant improvement in endothelial functions.~\cite{Nakamura2014} Clinical study~\cite{Ayaori2013} also suggested flow-mediated dilation in type II diabetes have been severly reduced under both sitagliptin (50mg/d) and alogliptin (25mg/d) medication.

DPP4 inhibitory theropy also seems to promote natriuresis.
