For~\textit{homo sapine} DPP4, prolyl oligopeptidase family region is located towards the C-terminus of the protein chain and spans from amino acid 561 to amino acid 763. Structurally, C-terminal domain 2$^{o}$ structures consist of 10 $\alpha$-helices, 8 $\beta$-strands. This region contains catalytic region (i.e. aa605-aa635)~\cite{Rawlings1991,Barrett1992,Polg√°r1992,Rawlings1994} with catalytic sequence "GW\textbf{S}YG"~\cite{Ogata_1992}, which coincides with serine proteases' consensus ("GX\textbf{S}XG"), therefore DPP4 is characterised as a serine protease. Further study on DPP4 structure reviewed the serine catalytic triad is made of Ser630, Asp708 and His740 with the active Serine site at Ser630. Structurally, a single disulfide bond crosslinking between Cys-649-Cys-762 and helix structure Met-746-Ser-764 at C-terminus. Within this catalytic domain

This region is highly preserved through evolution and is suspected that the catalytic activity is essential to biological functions, therefore is selected under positive pressure.
