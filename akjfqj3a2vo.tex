For~\textit{homo sapine} DPP4, prolyl oligopeptidase family region is located towards the C-terminus of the protein chain and spans from amino acid 561 to amino acid 763. Structurally, C-terminal domain 2$^{o}$ structures consist of 10 $\alpha$-helices, 8 $\beta$-strands. This region contains catalytic region (i.e. aa605-aa635)~\cite{Rawlings1991,Barrett1992,Polg√°r1992,Rawlings1994} with catalytic sequence "GW\textbf{S}YG"~\cite{Ogata_1992}, which coincides with serine proteases' consensus ("GX\textbf{S}XG"), therefore DPP4 is characterised as a serine protease. Further study on DPP4 structure reviewed the serine catalytic triad is made of Ser630, Asp708 and His740 with Ser630 at the active site. Structurally, one disulfide bond (Cys649-Cys762) stabilizes $\alpha$-helix structure (Met746-Ser764) and $\beta$-sheet at C-terminus. In DPP4 dimmer formation, both $\alpha$-helix Met746-Ser764 and Gln714-Asp725 together with $\beta$-strand Asp729-Thr736 form the central dimerization motif, where

This region is highly preserved through evolution and is suspected that the catalytic activity is essential to biological functions, therefore is selected under positive pressure.
