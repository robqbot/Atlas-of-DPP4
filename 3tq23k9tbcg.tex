\subsection{Obesity}
Animal study~\cite{Conarello2003} has revealed the resistance in high-fat dietary induced obesity in DPP4~\textsuperscript{-/-} mice model, which is believed due to increased net energy consumption evidenced by the elevated expression of uncoupling protein-1 and $\beta$-3 adrenergic receptor caused by the ablation of DPP4 activity. Later studies by~\citet{Bordicchia2012} and~\citet{Lockie2012} have further demonstrated DPP4 substrates BNP, GLP-1 and oxyntomodulin can promote respiration, energy expenditure and stimulate thermogenesis in interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). In addition, further studies have demonstrated DPP4 has regulatory effects on peptides/proteins that exhibit can stimulate food-intake including NPY, PYY, enterostatin. However one study by~\citet{Drucker2006} failed to observe suppression effects on diatery intake and gastric emptying. This may suggest that moderate inhibition in DPP4 may not be sufficient.
