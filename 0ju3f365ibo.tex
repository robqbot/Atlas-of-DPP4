\subsection{Cardiovascular system}
DPP4 has been commonly found to express in vascular endothelial cells and venous capillary beds.~\cite{Matheeussen2013,Shigeta2012} hDPP4 expression~\cite{Nemoto1999} and enzymatic activity has been identified in fibroblasts.~\cite{Ospelt2010}
\par 
Irregular incretin hormone activity can deregulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and can result direct or indirect complications on cardiovascular system.~\cite{Ussher2012} Due to the fact that DPP4 regulates a number of common incretin including GLP-1, inhibition DPP4 activity in type II diabetic therapy can result complex response in diabetic heart and coronary vasculature.~\cite{Ussher2014}  DPP4\textsuperscript{-/-} and DPP4 knockout mice model studies have demonstrated a cardioprotective property in left anterior descending artery ligation.~\cite{Sauv√©2010}
