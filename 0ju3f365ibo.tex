\subsection{Cardiovascular system}
DPP4 has been commonly found to express in vascular endothelial cells and venous capillary beds.~\cite{Matheeussen2013,Shigeta2012} hDPP4 expression~\cite{Nemoto1999} and enzymatic activity has been identified in fibroblasts.~\cite{Ospelt2010}
\par 
Irregular incretin hormone activity can deregulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and can result direct or indirect complications on cardiovascular system.~\cite{Ussher2012} Due to the
