This heavy glycosylation is believed to be important for DPP4 sorting and maturation. DPP4 precursor with high mannose (roughly 100 kDa) is firstly processed in the Golgi apparatus to result mature DPP4 with heavy N- and O-linked glycans (roughly 124 kDa)~\cite{Matter_1991}. The correct sorting of the mature DPP4 is believed via interactions between those linked glycans and lipid microdomains
