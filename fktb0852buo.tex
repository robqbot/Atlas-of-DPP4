\subsection{Adipose tissue}
In human, DPP4 has been found in both sc and viseral adipose cells.~\cite{Lamers2011} In addition, DPP4 expression has also been observed on both dendritic cells and macrophages if they are in contact with visceral adipose deports.~\cite{Zhong2013} In disease models, elevated DPP4 expression has commonly been found, including obesity and inflammation~\cite{Zhong2013}. In impaired glucoregulatory models, increased circulating DPP4 level has also been associated with increasing BMI, Baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA\textsubscript{1c}), where both indications have been commonly used
