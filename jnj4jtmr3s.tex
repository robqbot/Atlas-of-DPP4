\subsection{Introcellular domain (aa1-6)}

This short, hydrophilic domain consist of first 6 amino acids from DPP4 N-terminus. The exact functions related to this region is still unclear. However, early study by~\citet{Hong1990} has demonstrated that neither exclusion of initial methionine (M) or deletion of this intro-cellular domain entirely do not affect the translocation of nascent DPP4 in cell, nevertheless, significantly affecting DPP4 membrane 

Study has demonstrated the short cytoplasmic domain is critical for T-cell signalling and proliferation through its interact with protein CARMA-1. \cite{Ohnuma_2007}
