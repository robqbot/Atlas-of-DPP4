\subsection{Flexible segment (aa29 - aa48)}

This region acts as the connection node between transmembrane anchor and soluble form of DPP4 (sDPP4 39-766). Potentially, sDPP4 is released mostly likely due to the hydrolysis of hDPP4 by serine protease Granzyme B (S01.010, UniProtID:P10144) after Asp38 (ATAD~\textbar SRKT).~\cite{Song_2018}
