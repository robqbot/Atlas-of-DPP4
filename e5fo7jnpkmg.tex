\subsection{Substrates' entrance to the active site}

The enzymatic active site of DPP4 is hidden away by the $\beta$-propeller domain, the direct access to the active site is restricted. Two possible access mechanisms to the active site have been referred as tunnel access and side access. The tunnel access is consistance with prorelative a longer route to the active site with distance measured 37 \AA. The side access is an oval shaped opening with dimensions of 15 and 22 \AA and the distance to the active site has been messasured as 20 \AA.~\cite{Engel_2003, Rasmussen_2002,Weihofen_2004} Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a native substrate of DPP4 and has been found to enter DPP4 active site via side opening. ~\cite{Aertgeerts_2004}
