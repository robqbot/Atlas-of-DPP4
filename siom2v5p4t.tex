\section{DPP4 Inhibitors}
DPP4 has a large array of substrates with some~\textit{in vivo} cleavage evidence like GLP-1 and GIP. By inhibiting DPP4 enzymatic activity, it can promote circular level of both GLP-1 and GIP, which preserves cyto-protective actions and in turn restore glucoregulatory function of insulin in type II diabitics. Inhibition of DPP4 enzymatic activity may also
