\section{DPP4 Inhibitors}
DPP4 has a large array of substrates with some~\textit{in vivo} cleavage evidence like GLP-1 and GIP. By inhibiting DPP4 enzymatic activity, it can promote circular level of both GLP-1 and GIP, which preserves cyto-protective actions and in turn restore glucoregulatory function of insulin in type II diabetes. Inhibition of DPP4 enzymatic activity may also alter cellular signalling, which is prominent in the case of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY). The signalling pathway is altered from before DPP4 cleavage via Y1R-Y5R to after cleavage pathway Y2R-Y5R.~
