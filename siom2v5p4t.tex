\section{DPP4 Inhibitors}
DPP4 has a large array of substrates with some~\textit{in vivo} cleavage evidence like GLP-1 and GIP. By inhibiting DPP4 enzymatic activity, it can promote circular level of both GLP-1 and GIP, which preserves cyto-protective actions and in turn restore glucoregulatory function of insulin in type II diabetes. Inhibition of DPP4 enzymatic activity may also alter cellular signalling, which is promnent in the case of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY)
