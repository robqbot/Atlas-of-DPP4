\subsection{Transmembrane region (aa7- aa29)}

This region forms $\alpha$-
DPP4 is anchored in the plasma membrane by this type II transmembrane protein spans 22 aa in length, which forms polytopic transmembrane $\alpha$-helical protein with hydrophobic core.~\cite{Hong_1990} Structurally, type II transmembrane protein is a bitopic protein and only span lipid bilayer single time with N-terminus on the cytoplasmic side and transmembrane helix sits next to the N-terminus and its C-terminal domain is typically targeted to the destination of ER lumen.~\cite{Luckey} It is likely that this transmembrane protein  the
