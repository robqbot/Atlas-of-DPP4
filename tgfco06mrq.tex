\subsection{Immune System}
DPP4/CD26 ubiquitously expressed in many cell types in both innate and adaptive immune system including T cells, activated B cells, activated natural killer cells and myeloid cells.~\cite{Abbott1994,Shingu2003,Hong1989,Gutschmidt1981,Dikov2004,BÃ¼hling1995,Tanaka1992,Gorrell1991}  

\subsubsection{NK cells}

\subsubsection{Myeloid cells}
In human, DPP4 expression has been found on dendritic cells~\cite{Zhong2013,Gliddon2002,Epardaud2004} and
