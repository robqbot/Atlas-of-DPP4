\subsection{Immune System}
DPP4/CD26 ubiquitously expressed in many cell types in both innate and adaptive immune system including T cells, activated B cells, activated natural killer cells and myeloid cells.~\cite{Abbott1994,Shingu2003,Hong1989,Gutschmidt1981,Dikov2004,BÃ¼hling1995,Tanaka1992,Gorrell1991}

\subsubsection{Myeloid cells}
Evident~\cite{Zhong2013,Gliddon2002} found DPP4 expression on dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages DPP4 expression also found in rats~\cite{Epardaud2004, Ellingsen2007}. In rats, DPP4 has been found in lysosomes from both stellate macrophages and microglia cells, the DPP4 expression can be elevated upon c
