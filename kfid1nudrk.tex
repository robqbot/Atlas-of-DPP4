\subsection{DPP4 inhibitor selectivity}
While DPP4 possess rare post proline hydrolytic activity, DPP4 family enzyme FAP, DPP8 and DPP9 all share significant homology and have DPP4-like enzymatic potency.~\cite{Kirby_2010,Thornberry_2007} Although DPP8 and DPP9 share DPP4 enzymatic activity, study have suggested the potency is much lower. FAP also share portion of degradation repertoire with DPP4, members include GLP-1, GIP, Neuropeptide-Y (NPY), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), substance-P (SP) and peptide-YY (PYY).~\cite{Keane_2011} Despite lateral overlapping between DPP4 family members, DPP4 seems to be the only member that truncates chemokines.~\cite{Keane_2011}
