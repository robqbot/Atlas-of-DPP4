\subsubsection {Sialylation}
Sialyic acid are often used to refer a group of N- or O-substituted derivatives of neuraminic acid, which is a monosaccharide and has a nine-carbon backbone.~\cite{Vocadlo_2009} Sialylation is a chemical process, where a single monosaccharide forms covalent attachment with glycan component of glycoproteins

This process is key to a number of cellular functions such as signal recognition and cell adhesion. Glycoprotein function, stability, and metabolism in particular are dependent upon correct sialylation.
