\subsubsection {Sialylation}
Sialyic acid are often used to refer a group of N- or O-substituted derivatives of neuraminic acid, which is a monosaccharide and has a nine-carbon backbone.~\cite{Vocadlo_2009} Sialylation is a chemical process, where a single monosaccharide forms covalent attachment with glycan component of glycosalated proteins. This sialyic acid capping has been found to have profond molecular functions in glycoprotein function, stability, and metabolism; consequently correct sialylation is critical for cellular functions like signal recognition and cell adhesion.~\cite{Bhide_2016}
