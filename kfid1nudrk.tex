\subsection{DPP4 inhibitor selectivity}
While DPP4 possess rare post proline hydrolytic activity, DPP4 family enzyme FAP, DPP8 and DPP9 all share significant homology and have DPP4-like enzymatic potency.~\cite{Kirby_2010,Thornberry_2007} Although DPP8 and DPP9 share DPP4 enzymatic activity, study have suggested the potency is much lower. FAP also share portion of degradation repertoire with DPP4, members include GLP-1, GIP, Neuropeptide Y, B-type natriuretic peptide, substance P and peptide YYNAP, BNP, SP and PYY.~\cite{Keane_2011}
