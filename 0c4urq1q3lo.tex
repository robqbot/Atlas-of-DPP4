\citet{Hopsu-Havu1966} has firstly discovered DPP4 in rat liver homogenates. The original interest was due to its capacity to hydrolise penultimate Proline, which is commonly found in collagens (-Gly-Pro-). Nevertheless, the later research has found that DPP4's inabilily to cleave Pro-Pro and Pro-Hyp dipeptides (commonly follows -Gly-Pro- in collagens), which baffled our understanding of DPP4's roles in collagen metabolism.

DPP4 has been referred as adenosine a
