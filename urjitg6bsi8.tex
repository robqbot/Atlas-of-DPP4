The human DPP4 IV gene span approximately around 70 kb and is found on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q24.3). The gene consists of 26 exons with each size varies from 45 b to 1.4 kb.~\cite{Abbott1994} The 5'-flanking region has missing both TATA box and CAAT box, but a G-C rich region spans 300 bp which is suspected to promote binding with number of transcription factors like NF$\kappa$B, AP2 and Sp1~\cite{Abbott1994,Böhm1995} The transcription of DPP4 IV gene has been found in two mRNA forms with length of 2.8 and 4.2 kb respectively.

Human DPP4 protein consists of 766 amino acids~\cite{Bär2003,Misumi1992}, which has 6 structurally and functionally distinctive regions. DPP4 can form both homo-dimmer from DPP4 monomer or hetero-dimmer with other S9b family members. Previous mutagenic studies~\cite{Chien_2004,Chien_2006} have demonstrated the dimerisation is critical to DPP4 enzymatically activivity. The same group has also demonstrated three regions in DPP4 monomer that contribute to the dimmer formation: transmembrane region, C
