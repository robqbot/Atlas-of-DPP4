\subsubsection{Tetramer and cell-cell interaction}

In addition to dimmer formation, DPP4 can also form tetramer, both heavily involve this $beta$-propeller blade region. In contrast to hydrophobic dimmer formation, the tetramer formation is dominated by hydrophilic interaction on the interface.~\cite{Engel_2003} Asn-279 is glycosylated and is at the heart of the tetramer interface~\cite{Engel_2003}, therefore, is believed the glycosylation at Asn is important for DPP4 tetramer formation. In addition, ADA-binding is also suspect to interrupt DPP4 tetramer formation, this is due to interface overlapping, where Leu-294 and Val-341 on DPP4 are not critical for ADA binding  the  site strongly  
\par 
DPP4 tetramerization may contribute to cell antigen property of DPP4 (CD26), given two cell membrane bounded DPP4 can form dimmer and two cell with surface bounded DPP4 dimmer from adjacent direction can interact to form tetramer to initiate cell-cell contact, studies by~\citet{Cheng1998,Abdel-Ghany1998} using soluble DPP4 in a cell adhesion model has demonstrated such potential.
