\subsubsection{Tetramer and cell-cell interaction}

In addition to dimmer formation, DPP4 can also form tetramer, both heavily involve this $beta$-propeller blade region. In contrast to hydrophobic dimmer formation, the tetramer formation is dominated by hydrophilic interaction on the interface.~\cite{Engel_2003} Asn-279 has also been located at the
