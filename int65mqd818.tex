\subsubsection{Tetramer and cell-cell interaction}

In addition to dimmer formation, DPP4 can also form tetramer, both heavily involve this $beta$-propeller blade region. In contrast to hydrophobic dimmer formation, the tetramer formation is dominated by hydrophilic interaction on the interface.~\cite{Engel_2003} Asn-279 is glycosylated and is at the heart of the tetramer interface~\cite{Engel_2003}, therefore, is believed the glycosylation at Asn is important for DPP4 tetramer formation.

DPP4 tetramerization may contribute to cell antigen property of DPP4 (CD26), given the so
