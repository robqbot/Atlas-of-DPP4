\subsubsection {Sialylation}
Sialic acid (Figure~\ref{664721}) are often used to refer a group of N- or O-substituted derivatives of neuraminic acid, which is a monosaccharide and has a nine-carbon backbone.~\cite{Vocadlo_2009} Sialylation is a chemical process, where a single monosaccharide forms covalent attachment with glycan component of glycosylated proteins. This sialic acid capping has been found to have profound molecular functions in glycoprotein function, stability, and metabolism; consequently correct sialylation is critical for cellular functions like signal recognition and cell adhesion.~\cite{Bhide_2016}

The degree of N-terminal sialylation in DPP4~\cite{Stehling_1999} seems associating with numerous physiological conditions. Hypersialylation by extreme anionic isoforms can lead to the modification of DPP4 surface charges and result DPP4 enzymatic activity more significantly inhibited by Tat and cationic peptides, consequently lead to more acceptance to HIV infection.~\cite{SMITH_1998} Also hyper-sialylation on DPP4 have been observed to silence T-cell activity~\ \cite{Cuchacovich2001} \cite{K_hne_1996} 
\textit{In vitro} study conducted by~\citet{Schmauser1999} suggested that the degree of sialylation contributes to different isoelectric points (IP) for DPP4 and was responsible for extraordinary migration behavior under sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
