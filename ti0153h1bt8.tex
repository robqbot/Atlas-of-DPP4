\subsubsection {Sialylation}
Sialic acid (Figure~\ref{664721}) are often used to refer a group of N- or O-substituted derivatives of neuraminic acid, which is a monosaccharide and has a nine-carbon backbone.~\cite{Vocadlo_2009} Sialylation is a chemical process, where a single monosaccharide forms covalent attachment with glycan component of glycosylated proteins. This sialic acid capping has been found to have profound molecular functions in glycoprotein function, stability, and metabolism; consequently correct sialylation is critical for cellular functions like signal recognition and cell adhesion.~\cite{Bhide_2016}

\textit{In vitro} study conducted by~\citet{Schmauser1999} suggested that the degree of sialylation contributes to different isoelectric points (IP) for DPP4 and was responsible for extraordinary migration behavior under sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). 
The degree of N-terminal sialylation in DPP4~\cite{Stehling_1999} seems to be associated with numerous physiological conditions. Hypersialylation on DPP4 have been associate with increasing in age~\cite{SMITH_1998}, which can lead to the modification of DPP4 surface charges and result DPP4 enzymatic activity more significantly inhibited by Tat and cationic peptides, consequently lead to more acceptance to HIV infection.~\cite{SMITH_1998} Also hypersialylation on DPP4 has been observed to silence T-cell activity, consequently increases the symptoms of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.~\cite{Cuchacovich2001}  
While, lack DPP4 sialylation is suspected in spinocellular lung cancer.
