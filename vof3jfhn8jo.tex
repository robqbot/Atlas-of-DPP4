\subsubsection{ADA binding site}
Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a deamination enzyme, which facilitates irreversible deamination of adenosine to inosine and 2' deoxyadenosine to 2' deoxyinosine~\cite{Franco_1998}. In the absent or weak ADA activity, the development of B-cell and T-cell are severely impaired, which in turn causing combined immunodeficiency diseases.~\cite{Cristalli2001} Interestingly, upon forming complex, both ADA and DPP4 possess individual enzymatic activity while co-stimulate T cell proliferation.~\cite{De_Meester_1999}  
\par 
ADA binding occurs at DPP4 cysteine-rich region,
Leu294 and Val341 on DPP4 have been demonstrated via mutagenesis to be critical for ADA-DPP4 binding.~\cite{Abbott_1999} Leu294 and Val341 are located on two short $\alpha$-helices (291-294, 341-343 respectively), those two $\alpha$-helices are suspected to play an important role in ADA binding.
