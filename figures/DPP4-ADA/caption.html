<div data-label="100877">An Illustration of DPP4 monomers and DPP4 dimmer structures, where the transmembrane domain plays an important role in DPP4 dimerization. Structures illustrated here were produced using PyMOL with homo sapiens DPP4 and bos taurus ADA co-crystallization (PDB ID: 1W1I). In addition, the demonstration of DPP4 inhibitor (Linagliptin) binding at DPP4 catalytic pocket was using PDB structure&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div></div>
