<div data-label="751691">DPP4 tetramerization can bring two cells surface into close contact. The tetramerization interaction is at propeller region, upon ADA binding may interrupt tetramerization and vise versa, this competition to access binding surface may lead to physiological consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Structures illustrated here were produced using PyMOL with homo sapiens DPP4 and bos taurus ADA co-crystallization (PDB ID: 1W1I).&nbsp;</div>
