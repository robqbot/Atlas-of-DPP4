<div data-label="783429">This isGlycosylation on the mammalian cell surface. (A) Diagrammatic representation of glycosylation on glycoconjugates of the mammalian cell surface including glycolipid, proteoglycan, N-linked and O-linked glycoprotein molecules. (B) The types of mammalian glycans, their diversity and complexity. Glycan structures of the six classes of secretory glycan (N-glycans, hyaluronan, O-glycans, glycolipids, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and glycosaminoglycans) and the single intracellular glycan, O-linked β-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), are shown. Representative examples of each type are indicated using the symbol nomenclature for monosaccharides (see symbols). PI is phosphatidylinositol, Et–P denotes a phosphoethanolamine linkage, and –s denotes the sulfation positions of the glycosaminoglycan chains. a caption</div>
