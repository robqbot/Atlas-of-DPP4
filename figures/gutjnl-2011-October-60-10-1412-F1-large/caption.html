<div data-label="783429">Glycosylation on the mammalian DPP4 at cell surface. (A) Diagrammatic representation of glycosylation on DPP4 including  N-linked and O-linked glycan molecules. (B) The types of mammalian glycans, their diversity and complexity. Glycan structures of the six classes of secretory glycan (N-glycans, hyaluronan, O-glycans, glycolipids, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and glycosaminoglycans), O-linked β-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), are shown. Representative examples of each type are indicated using the symbol nomenclature for monosaccharides (see symbols). PI is phosphatidylinositol and –s denotes the sulfation positions of the glycosaminoglycan chains.&nbsp;</div>
